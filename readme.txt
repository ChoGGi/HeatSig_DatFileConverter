If Heat Signature changes around how the files are saved you could lose your files, so always backup before doing anything.
I tried to make it safe, but you get what you pay for.
As of Sep 25 2017, this works with all dat files (be wary using it after an update to HS).

run DatFileConverter.exe
double click to decode/encode, double right-click to send file to recycle bin.
See DatFileConverter.ini for some options (pick editor, scan steam workshop saves)

Save files are located in %APPDATA%\Heat_Signature
Characters are in "Galaxy 1\Characters" (or 2 or 3)
Retired items/Captured characters are in "Workshop" folder


You can also drag and drop dat/txt files on the exe to convert without GUI
  Drop save.dat on exe
  Edit save.dat.txt file
  Drop save.dat.txt file on exe
  Start game
You can drop both dat and txt files at the same time.
