If you don't trust random executables from somebody on the Steam forums (and you shouldn't...)
You can instead convert/run DatFileConverter.ahk with https://autohotkey.com

It's a pretty dead simple process to convert it to an exe:
Run AutoHotkey\Compiler\ahk2exe.exe, drag and drop ahk, press convert

Encode/Decode are v0.0.2, but if you want something you can only Encode/Decode with then have at it
